# MathEX

(Math Exercices for students to practice basic Math Skills)

This project provides a common platform for students and admin (teacher/parent) where students can exercise basic math operations
through practice tests and Admin can add/edit/delete tests and check the scores for all students. This application is designed to save
time and keep track of students's performance in the tests.

# Motivation
I have created this project for my kid as I don't get much time these days to prepare paper based math practice tests and moreover, 
I don't get mixed questions assignments/worksheets even on the internet the way I want. So, I have created this application where I 
can create customized practice tests as an Admin and my kid can login on to this application and practice the tests and even check them.

# Built With
HTML, CSS, JavaScript,
